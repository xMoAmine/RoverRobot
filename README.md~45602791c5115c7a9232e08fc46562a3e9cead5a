## Purpose
Job briefings are an important part of planning safe work. Job briefings are also required by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [29 CFR 1926.952](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ceeaf016fdd21de13fffb416153479ad&node=se29.8.1926_1952&rgn=div8). This work practice will help you understand what to expect during job briefings and how to participate to comply with OSHA requirements.

-----------

## Scope
This work practice describes the four elements of job briefings: daily briefing, job site assessment, job briefing, and post-job briefing. This work practice explains when each element is completed, what you can expect to talk about during each element, and the required documentation for each element.
 
This work practice is intended to help crew members understand each element of a job briefing, including how they must contribute and participate. This work practice does not describe crew supervisor, Employee in Charge (EIC), or designated crew member (DCM) responsibilities.
 
-----------
## Work Practice
There are four elements of job briefings:

1. Daily briefing.
2. Job site assessment.
3. Job briefing.
4. Post-job briefing.  

Every job requires these four elements, including storm response and service restoration jobs.

> **Note:**
> When you work alone, you must complete the four elements of a job briefing as carefully as when you are part of a crew. Lone worker briefings are planning processes that include thinking through all of the same topics as crew briefings, including hazards, work procedures, and emergency plans.
> 
> You do not have to document job briefings as a lone worker. If you start a job by working alone, but another crew member or entire crew arrives later to help, you do have to document job briefings, starting when the other crew member or crew arrives at the job site.
 
### Daily Briefing
The EIC or DCM will hold a daily briefing at the beginning of each work day. All the crew members who will work on the job that day have to attend the daily briefing. The daily briefing gets the entire crew involved in planning for the day’s work.
 
The daily briefing is held at your reporting location, not at the job site.

#### Daily Briefing Requirements
The daily briefing will include the following subjects, at minimum:

* Crew member check-in.
* Work plans for the day.
* Hazards associated with loading and unloading material.
* Preparing the vehicles that will be used for the day’s work.
* Plans for traveling to the job site.
 
#### Daily Briefing Documentation
The details of the daily briefing are not documented. You do have to initial a copy of the Daily Briefing Form (FM-0001-2015) before leaving the daily briefing. The Daily Briefing Form is a reusable laminated card that is kept at each reporting location.
 
### Job Site Assessment
After the daily briefing, you will leave the reporting location and drive to the job site. When you arrive at the job site, you must complete a job site assessment.
 
During the job site assessment, you gather information about the job site that could affect the safety of the day’s work. You will talk about this information during the job briefing.
 
#### Job Site Assessment Requirements
During the job site assessment, you look for hazards and gather information about characteristics and conditions of the job site.
 
> **WARNING**

> During the job site assessment, treat all lines and equipment as if they are energized.
 
> Keep enough distance from ungrounded lines and equipment so that you cannot come within reach or extended reach of the minimum approach distance (MAD). For example, keep enough distance so that even if you trip and fall by accident, you will not come within the MAD.
 
> If you are not a qualified electrical worker, stay at least 10 ft away from downed electrical lines, equipment and poles during the job site assessment.

Examples of information to gather during the job site assessment include:
 
* Voltages of lines and equipment.
* Sources of induced voltage.
* Conditions of poles and structures.
* Presence of manholes or vaults.
* Traffic control requirements.
* Weather conditions.
* Terrain and surroundings, including poisonous plants and unstable trees or limbs.
* Presence of wildlife, pets, customers, pedestrians, or workers from other utilities.
 
#### Job Site Assessment Documentation
You do not have to document the details of your job site assessment. Instead, you should make mental notes of the hazards, characteristics, and conditions you observe so that you can talk about them during the job briefing.
 
### Job Briefing
The job briefing is a detailed discussion of work plans, job hazards, information gathered during the job site assessment, and information that affects the safety of the work to be done.
 
#### Job Briefing Requirements
The EIC or DCM will use the Job Briefing Form (FM-0002-2015) as a guide for leading the job briefing. You should mention any notes and observations from your job site assessment during the job briefing.

The job briefing will include the following topics:

* Work procedures.
* Hazards for the work to be done.
* Special precautions.
* Energy source controls.
* Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements.

> **WARNING**
 
> If you are involved in a job briefing, you must know the specific hazards identified for the job and how to mitigate or eliminate the hazards before you begin working.
 
> If you are unsure of the job hazards or how to mitigate or eliminate them, ask the EIC or DCM during the job briefing. **Do not begin working if you have any questions about the job hazards**.
 
Job briefings are held when:
 
* Starting any job.
* Resuming work after the job is interrupted for any reason, including lunch breaks.
* Adding or removing a crew member from the job.
* Making any change in job conditions that could affect safety.
 
During the job briefing, the EIC or DCM will identify a critical task observer to observe any critical, complicated, or hazardous work. The EIC or DCM will write the observer’s name on the Job Briefing Form. The critical task observer cannot be assigned to operate any equipment during the critical, complicated, or hazardous work.
 
#### Job Briefing Documentation
The EIC or DCM will use the Job Briefing Form to document job briefings. You must initial the Job Briefing Form after each job briefing.
The crew supervisor will keep the completed Job Briefing Form at the local office for 90 days.

### Post-Job Briefing
The post job briefing is held when the job is completed. All crew members who are on the job site when the job is completed will participate in the post-job briefing.

#### Post-Job Briefing Requirements
During the post-job briefing, you will talk about how the job went, including any problems, suggestions, and lessons learned. You will also identify any follow-up actions that are needed for the job.

#### Post-Job Briefing Documentation
The EIC or DCM will use the Job Briefing Form to document post-job briefings. You must initial the Job Briefing Form after each post-job briefing.
